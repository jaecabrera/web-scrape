Poor awareness of the condition and inadequate evidence for the efficacy of treatment mean that no government in an endemic country yet offers lymphoedema management for patients with podoconiosis. Among patients with filarial lymphoedema, trials suggest that limb care is effective in reducing the most disabling sequelae: episodes of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a simple, inexpensive lymphoedema management package would reduce the incidence of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis in adult patients with podoconiosis in northern Ethiopia.'}}"

Participants were aware of their group assignment, but researchers doing all analyses were masked to treatment group. The primary outcome was incidence of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis episodes in the total period of observation of each participant, measured by use of validated patient self-reported pictorial diaries.

Extracellular small non-coding RNAs (exRNAs) have been associated with cardiac inflammation and fibrosis and we hypothesized that they are associated with post-MI LVRm phenotypes. RNA sequencing of exRNAs was performed on plasma samples from patients with ""beneficial"" (decrease LVESVI ≥ 20%, n = 11) and ""adverse"" (increase LVESVI ≥ 15%, n = 11) LVRm. Selected differentially expressed exRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR (n = 331) and analyzed for their association with LVRm determined by cardiac MRI. Principal components of exRNAs were associated with LVRm phenotypes post-MI; specifically, LV mass, LV ejection fraction, LV end systolic volume index, and fibrosis. We then investigated the temporal regulation and cellular origin of exRNAs in murine and cell models and found that: 1) plasma and tissue miRNA expression was temporally regulated; 2) the majority of the miRNAs were increased acutely in tissue and at sub-acute or chronic time-points in plasma; 3) miRNA expression was cell-specific; and 4) cardiomyocytes release a subset of the identified miRNAs packaged in exosomes into culture media in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation. In conclusion, we find that plasma exRNAs are temporally regulated and are associated with measures of post-MI LVRm.'}}"
